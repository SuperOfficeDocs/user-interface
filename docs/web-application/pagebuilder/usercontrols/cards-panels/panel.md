# Panel

The `panel` object is the outer UI frame for the interface. It can contain any number of cards, which are canvases on which we can place views using different layout rules.

> [!NOTE]
> It is up to the panel implementation to interpret what these cards are going to be used for, and how they are shown.

The cards can contain any number of views, which are laid out according to the definition on the card and the properties of the control.
