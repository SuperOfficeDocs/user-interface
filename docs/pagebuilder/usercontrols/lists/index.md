# Drop-down list UserControls

In a SuperOffice page, there can be many types of controls: here we focus on the drop-down lists.

## Types of list controls

There are 2 types of lists in SuperOffice:

* SoListBox
* MDOList

The **SoListBox** is a drop-down control that will display a flat list. It does not support categorized lists and searching.

The **Multi-Departmental Orientation (MDO) list** is the control that will support sub-list and search functionality. It supports categorized lists as well as searching.

The config file settings for both the controls are similar. The MDO list control is the most widely used.
